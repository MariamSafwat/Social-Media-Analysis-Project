# Social-Media-Analysis-Project
The project aims at applying algorithms based on graph theory to compute the centrality property for each node in undirected connected graph.\
Algorithms implemented using C++ and GUI using Qt.
## Centrality Algorithms:
- Degree Centrality 
- Closeness centrality
- Betweenness Centrality
### Inputs:
Number of nodes and number of edges and their weights.
### Outputs:
Centrality for nodes printed ascendingly according to the node’s id.\
visualization of the graph such that nodes with higher centrality are clear.
